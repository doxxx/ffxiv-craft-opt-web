# FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website

This project contains the source for the [FFXIV Crafting Optimizer Website](http://ffxiv.lokyst.net/). 
It uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), [AngularUI Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), 
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve the `app` subdirectory in this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run:
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`
* install Docker and run:
  * `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t ffxiv-craft-opt-web-dev .`
  * `docker run --rm -it -p 8001:8001 ffxiv-craft-opt-web-dev`

The last two options will serve the website on port 8001. Note that if you're using Docker on 
Windows or OS X via VirtualBox, you'll have to use the IP address of the Linux VM (usually 
192.168.99.100) that is hosting Docker, instead of `localhost`. The Dockerfile.dev method will 
mount the app source as a volume so chnages will be reflected when the browser is refreshed.

### Translations

Localization files can be found in `app/locale`. The `app/locale/en.json` file is purposefully 
missing because the English strings are used as the translation keys. Strings which require
interpolation are defined in app.js so that they can be displayed immediately as a fallback until 
the actual locale json file finishes loading.
